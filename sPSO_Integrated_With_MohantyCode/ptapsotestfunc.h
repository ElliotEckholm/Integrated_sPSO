\brief Struct to pass fitness function specific parameters.

   If a fitness function foo.c needs special parameters, define them through a struct in its header file foo.h. 
   The fitness function here does not need special parameters but we define a 
   dummy one as an example. Special parameters are provided as fields of a struct. The name of
this struct should be unique and indicate the fitness function with which it is associated.
 This struct should be initialized before a call to the fitness function and a pointer to it should be assigned to the splParams field
   of the initialized fitFuncParams struct.
